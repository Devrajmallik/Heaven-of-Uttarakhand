                    famous ghat in Rishikesh at the banks of Ganges. Triveni Ghat remains overcrowded with devotee to
                    take ritual baths to get cleansed from their sins. Being the most venerated ghat in Rishikesh,
                    Triveni Ghat is even used by devotees to perform the last rites and rituals of their loved ones. The
                    ghat is famed for the Ganga aarti performed to the chants of Vedic hymns. The sight of oil leaves,
                    filled with diya and petals, which are released by devotees, floating on the pristine Ganga and the
                    traditional aarti is a sight to behold. On the bank of Triveni Ghat, one can visit the Gita Mandir,

                    rituals of the town, Rishikesh. The Maha Aarti is performed by chanting bhajans in praise of the
                    lord and is celebrated by beating electrifying drums and rhythmic bells. The prayers offered to the
                    lord are melodious and hypnotising, allowing you to feel the energy of the lord and connect with
                    him.
