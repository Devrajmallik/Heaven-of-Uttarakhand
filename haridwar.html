                <h3>Har Ki Pori</h3>
                <span class="desc">Har Ki Pauri, meaning the feet of Lord Vishnu (Hari), is a ghat on the banks of the
                    river Ganga and landmark of the Hindu holy city of Haridwar in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.

                    It is believed that it is the precise spot where the Ganga leaves the mountains and enters the
                    plains. The ghat is on the west bank of Ganga canal through which the Ganga is diverted just to the
                    north. Har Ki Pauri is also the area where thousands of pilgrims converge and the festivities
                    commence during the Kumbha Mela, which takes place every twelve years, and the Ardh Kumbh Mela,
                    which takes place every six years and the Punjabi festival of Vaisakhi, a harvest festival occurring
                    every year in the month of April.

                    Literally, "Har" means "God", "Ki" means " 's " and "Pauri" means "steps". Lord Vishnu is believed
                    to have visited the Brahmakund in Har Ki Pauri in the Vedic times. <br>
                    <br>GANGA AARTI
                    <br>
                    Each evening at sunset, the priests of Har ki Pauri perform the – Ganga Aarti – over an old
                    tradition. Lights are set on the water to drift downstream. A large number of people gather on both
                    banks of the ganga river to sing Ganga Aarti praises. At that time the priests hold large Fire Bowls
                    in their hands, rungs bells at the temples situated at the ghat and chants are chanted by the
                    priests. People flick Diya (made of leaves and flowers) into the river Ganges as a symbol of hopes
                    and wishes. However, on some special cases, like on the occurrence of eclipses, the time of the
                    Ganga Aarti is be altered accordingly.</span>

                <h3>Maa Mansa Devi Mandir</h3>
                <span class="desc">Mata Mansa Devi is a Hindu temple dedicated to goddess Mansa Devi, a form of Shakti,
                    in the Panchkula district of the Indian state of Haryana. The temple complex is spread of 100 acres
                    (0.40 km2) of the Shivalik foothills in the village of Bilaspur, near Sector 13 (earlier known as
                    Mani Majra) of Chandigarh, and Panchkula, 10 km from Chandi Mandir, another noted Devi shrine in the
                    region, both just outside Chandigarh.

                    It is one of the prominent Shakti Pitha temples of North India involving 7 Shakti goddesses, namely
                    Mata Mansa Devi, Naina Devi, Jawalamukhi, Chintpurni, Brajeshwari, Chamunda Devi and Jayanti Devi.
                    Thousands of devotees visit the shrine from various parts of the country, and especially during the
                    Navratra mela, this number rises to lakhs every day for the nine auspicious days. There are 3
                    temples in the complex and the main temple is the oldest. Maharaja Gopal Das Singh of Mani Majra,
                    who was enthroned in 1783, constructed the present main temple of Shri Mansa Devi, which is situated
                    on the Shivalik foothills in the village Bilaspur, Tehsil and District Panchkula, during the period
                    1811–1815. At a distance of 200 meters from the main temple is the Patiala Shivalaya temple which
                    was constructed by Karam Singh, a Jat Sikh, the then Maharaja of Patiala in the year 1840. This
                    temple had the patronage of Manimajra Princely State</span>

                <h3>Maa Chandi Devi Mandir</h3>
                <span class="desc">Chandi Devi Temple, Haridwar (Hindi: चण्डी देवी मंदिर, हरिद्वार) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Goddess Chandi Devi in the holy city of Haridwar in the Uttarakhand state of India. The temple is situated atop the Neel Parvat on the Eastern summit of the Sivalik Hills, the southernmost mountain chain of the Himalayas. Chandi Devi Temple was built in 1929 by Suchat Singh in his reign as the King of Kashmir. However, the main murti of Chandi Devi at the temple is said to have been installed in the 8th century by Adi Shankaracharya, one of the greatest priests of Hindu religion.The temple also known as Neel Parvat Teerth is one of the Panch Tirth (Five Pilgrimages) located within Haridwar.

                    Chandi Devi Temple is highly revered by devotees as a Siddh Peetha which is a place of worship where desires get fulfilled. It is one of three such Peethas located in Haridwar, the other two being Mansa Devi Temple and Maya Devi Temple. The Temple is located at a distance of 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from Har ki Pauri. To reach the temple one has to either follow the three kilometre trekking route from Chandighat and reach the shrine by climbing a number of steps or climb the recently introduced rope-way (cable car) service. The rope-way service known as Chandi Devi Udankhatola was introduced for the benefit of the pilgrims and it caters to the pilgrims also to the nearby located Mansa Devi shrine.</span>
