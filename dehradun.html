                <h3>Tapkeshwar Mahadev Mandir </h3>
                <span class="desc">Tapkeshwar Temple, also known as Tapkeshwar Mahadev Temple, is a temple in Dehradun
                    dedicated to Shiva. The temple is on the bank of the Tons River, built on top of a natural cave,
                    which holds the temple's main shivalinga.The Tapkeshwar Temple is alleged to be 6,000 years old.It
                    has a natural shivalinga in the cave, which became a place of reverence for the local people.

                    It is also believed that this was used as a residence by Dronacharya, the teacher of the Pandavas
                    and Kauravas in the Hindu epic Mahabharata; the cave is called Drona Cave after him. Dronacharya's
                    wife Kalyani was unable to breastfeed their newborn son Ashwatthama.As Dronacharya was unable to
                    afford a cow or cow's milk, Ashwatthama prayed to Shiva, who then fed him milk dripping from the
                    shivalinga in the cave. The temple is popular as both a tourist destination and a pilgrimage site in
                    Dehradun. Pilgrims bathe in the nearby sulphur-water springs before entering the temple.

                    Drona Cave, surrounded by hills, is a popular site for picnickers from Dehradun and nearby
                    districts.</span>

                <h3>Mindrolling Monastery</h3>
                <span class="desc">Mindrolling Monastery (Tibetan: སྨིན་གྲོལ་གླིང་དགོན་པ་, Wylie: min-dröl-ling gön-pa,
                    THL: smin-grol-gling dgon-pa, English: "Sublime Island of Ripening Liberation"), is one of the "Six
                    Mother Monasteries" of the Nyingma school in Tibet. It was founded by Rigzin Terdak Lingpa in 1676.
                    Tendrak Lingpa's lineage is known as the Nyo lineage. The name in Tibetan means "Place of Perfect
                    Emancipation". It is located in Zhanang County, Shannan Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region, China,
                    known as U-Tsang. Mindrolling Monastery is approximately 43 kilometers east of the Lhasa airport, on
                    the south side of the Tsangpo river. Mindrolling was heavily damaged in 1718 by the Dzungar Mongols
                    from East Turkestan. It was rebuilt during the reign of the Seventh Dalai Lama (1708–1757). Dungsay
                    Rinchen-namgyel and Jetsunma Mingyur Paldron, the son and daughter of Terdak Lingpa, supervised its
                    reconstruction.

                    For nearly 300 years its monastic university trained Nyingma scholars and yogis from all over Tibet.
                    In 1965, Khochhen Rinpoche and small group of monks began the process of re-establishing Mindrolling
                    monastery located near Clement Town, in Dehradun, Uttarakhand state, India. It now contains Ngagyur
                    Nyingma College, one of the largest Buddhist institutes in India.</span>
